          <p class="methodText">Nagendra Kumar Eleswarapu believes SAP team of Miracle Heights have built a strong squad who are capable of winning Employee Premier League title this year. The day belonged to the opponent batsmen who were in a mood to punish the spinners yet played equally good knock against the pacers including a blistering hook shot. Vinay Kumar Bommana played a career defining innings as his magnificent batting propelled a tough game against SAP team in the semi finals of Employee Premier League.
