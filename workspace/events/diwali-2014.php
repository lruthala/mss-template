Diwali, which translates literally as "row of lamps", is a celebration of the victory of good over evil, light over dark and knowledge over ignorance. It is principally a Hindu, Jain and Sikh festival. Traditions associated with Diwali can be traced back as far as 50-100 AD, to an autumnal festival for the dead – an origin similar to that of Halloween.
          </p>
          <p class="methodText">Historically, the origin of Diwali can be traced back to ancient India, when it was probably an important harvest festival. However Diwali is certainly the biggest and the brightest of all Hindu festivals which was also very well known as the “Festival of Lights”. 
          </p>
          <p class="methodText">All the employees of Miracle Software Systems, Inc. came with a good traditional attire and kicked off Diwali celebrations by decorating the foyers of CC1, CC2 and Cafeteria with colourful rangoli along with the oil lamps lightened up in between them. All the employees were served with a special sweet named “Bread Halwa” during their dinner as one of the specials on the menu for that day.
          </p>
          <p class="methodText">    Diwali is regarded as an auspicious time to make money, and during the festival Indian stock markets open for Muhurat Trading, a "special trading session that marks the end of the traditional financial year". Although most transactions during the session are small and symbolic, many people consider Diwali investments to be lucky. Newspapers often publish stock tips to coincide with the festival.
