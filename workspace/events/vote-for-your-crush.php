           <p class="methodText"><strong>February 14th - Miracle City & Miracle Heights, IND : </strong>Crush is a feeling of unexpected thought in our mind when a person appears like a spark in front of us. It couldn’t be expressed easily with the person we have crush on. It is human nature to be attracted to other people. The most common sign of having a crush is the feeling that you have a million butterflies flying around inside you when that special someone is around. It can also feel like your heart does a leap when you see your crush and you feel warm and giddy. If you find yourself, thinking about that special person more than you think about anything else, you most likely have a crush. 
</p>
          <p class="methodText">
We at Miracle are no exception for the experience of crush. So, we had an event on 14th February 2015 to celebrate this experiential eve. Vote For Your Crush is what we named the event as.  The event was organized among all the Miracle Employees on the eve of Valentine's Day.  The two who got more votes in this event were finalized as Mr. Valentine and Ms. Valentine. The event took place at both Miracle Heights and Miracle City. The employees felt free to express their crush by writing their crush’s name on a piece of paper as the valuable chits were kept highly secured and confidential.

       <p class="methodText">The moment of excitement began as soon as the counting of chits was completed. The HR teams gathered in Miracle's lobbies around 8pm IST with few employees wishing to see their crush's names announced. Within seconds the word got out that the Mr. Valentine and Ms. Valentine were being announced by Mr. Swaroop Varma from the HR department. Mr. Prasad (IIB) & Ms. Annapurna (EAI) from Miracle City and Mr. Surendra Raju (SAP) & Ms. Kusumanjali (Family Dollar) from Miracle Heights were declared as Mr. Valentine and Ms. Valentine respectively. Mr. Swaroop gifted the prizewinners wooden frames labeled with Mr. Valentine and Ms. Valentine along with a beautiful quote and Celebrations chocolates confirming that they are the best and the sweetest crush that Miraclites ever had.</p>
