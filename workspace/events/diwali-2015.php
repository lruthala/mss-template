           <p class="methodText"><strong>November 11th 2015 - Miracle City & Miracle Heights IND : </strong>Light a lamp of love! Blast a chain of sorrow! and Fire a flowerpot of happiness! Diwali , the festival of lights was here to destroy the darkness and lighten up everyone in all ways possible. It is a festival where people of all age groups participate and lighten the earthen 'diyas' (lamps), decorate their places and burst firecrackers. When the diyas are alighted their glow illuminates even the darkest of nights which signifies the enlightenment of soul and the triumph of good over evil.
</p>
          <p class="methodText">
Diwali is derived from a sanskrit word Dipavali, Dipa (“Lights”) and avali (“Series”), which gives the meaning as “Series of Lights”. Diwali is celebrated as honour to Lord Rama’s return to the city of Ayodhya after a long exile of 14 years. While some believe that it is celebrated as the return of Pandavas from the 12 years of Vanvas. For few it resembles new openings for year as they offer prayers to Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi. Though the stories or events vary, the spirit of the festival is to spread gaiety and euphoria.</p>
        
         <p class="methodText">It was a festive environment at Miracle, as the Miraclites celebrated Diwali with grandeur and enthusiasm. The corridors of CC1, CC2 and Cafeteria at Mcity were decorated with flower garlands and colourful rangoli giving them a traditional touch. Diyas were lighted and our beloved CEO,<strong>Prasad Lokam</strong>  had had encouraged the employees to ignite the firecrackers away from the office, to start the festival of lights at M-City and M-Heights. All the employees were served with a special sweet “Pongal” during their break time at M-city and M-Heights to fill their day with sweet memories.
