           <p class="methodText"><strong>January 14,15 & 16th - Miracle City & Miracle Heights, IND : </strong>Pongal is considered as the harvest festival of South India. It is one of the most important and popular Hindu festivals that we celebrated from January 14th, 2015 to January 16th, 2015. The festival marks a period of plenty, peace and happiness, while each of its days has a special religious significance. On the first day known as Bhogi, all the employees of Miracle City lighted up a big camp fire early in the morning at Miracle City Apartments and later in the morning all the labour working at Miracle were given traditional clothes. At Miracle Heights we had a Traditional Attire competition where all the employees took an active part and came forward with different traditional costumes.
