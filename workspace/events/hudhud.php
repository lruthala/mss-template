                            <strong>October 13th, 2014 - Miracle City, IND :</strong> After ducking the devastating effects of the 2004 tsunami and the 1977 cyclone, the "City of Destiny" sadly had its date with disaster on 12th of October, 2014 when a very severe cyclonic storm Hudhud tore through the city, unleashing widespread destruction and bringing the otherwise bustling city of nearly 20 lakh people to a grinding halt.
                        </p>
                        <p class="methodText">
                            They say that the best qualities of a human being come out in the most trying circumstances. That must be true, because when Cyclone Hudhud hit us a fortnight ago, our true Miracle heroes Sekhar Ketha, Jagadeesh Ganti, Vijay Varma Poosapati, Ranjan Ballikuri and George Victor Chelluri were born from a regular Sunday morning. Wind blew and glasses broke but they were there to hold down the fort and secure wherever possible.

                        <p class="methodText">
                            Words may not be enough to describe their selfless and courageous deed, but none the less we must raise our heads high for them being a part of our family. The damage at Miracle Heights was devastating, but it could have been much more, had it not been for those brave souls. They put their responsibility in front of their lives, while they battled the storm and shifted equipment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="methodText">
                            Miracle was lucky. We were able to get back power, ethernet and our work resumed as usual. Daily lives and livelihood improved and slowly we got back on our feet and started running again towards our goals. A fortnight after the storm hit, Team Miracle sits in an auditorium filled by love and most importantly power and air conditioning.
                        </p>
                        <p class="methodText">
                            This would never be possible without the secret force that has been battling out there for us all these days. We slept while they worked, and they continued working while we worked. They redefined the meaning of work ethic and 24/7 support. They were there when we needed them and were always ready to help us out. Dark nights and heavy machines were the least of their problems as they battled through rain, devastation, crumbled buildings and communication problems to do the impossible.

                            We donâ€™t know how many of you know how difficult it is to setup and run a facility. Team Miracle together was able to shift the entire facility and make it completely functional within days. This is no mean feat and it can be measured against some of the greatest achievements of the company. They ensured that we could work trouble free even when most of the city was still covered in darkness. They constructed the fort like true kings.

                            When Cyclone Hudhud hit us at Miracle, we were devastated. We had lost our precious Miracle Heights Facility and were left in darkness. But it didn't take long for the the Miracle Family to come together and put up a fight. While others were looking for water, we went looking for ethernet. While others were complaining about electricity we were cleaning the town. Remarkable it may be, but Miracle was backed up and running in 36 hours and we have never looked back since. This is not the end, it is just the beginning of something special.
