           <p class="methodText">“Ice-Cream in hot Summer, a day full of scoops of fun.” That is the main theme of celebrating the Ice Cream  Day. Ice cream derived from the earlier iced cream or cream ice is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. The history of ice cream is directly linked to the development of mechanical refrigeration in the later <strong>19th</strong> and <strong>20th</strong> centuries which led to development of the modern ice cream industry.

          <p class="methodText">Ice cream was so named because the appellation described the process. Centuries ago people started making refreshing summertime desserts by taking sweet cream or custard and cooling them down with ice. The chillier the cream, the more solid the product is. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan from United States recognized it as a fun and nutritious food that is enjoyed by a 90 percent of the nation’s population. So he declared the Ice Cream Day for every year. That’s how the journey started for <strong>“Ice Cream Day.”</strong>

</p>
          <p class="methodText"><p class="methodText">It was the coolest day for Miraclites in the hot summer of 2016, because Miracle celebrated Ice Cream Day. National Ice Cream Day is celebrated on the third Sunday of July and the month of July is the National Ice Cream Month. However, hot blistering days are already here and ahead while everyone is sustained by humidity. That’s why Miracle planned Ice Cream Day in this month to make Miraclites freeze in this hot sunny climate and enjoy with a malleable ice cream.</p> 
          <p class="methodText"><p class="methodText">Celebrated on <strong>May 27th, 2016,</strong> Ice Cream Day at Miracle was well received and has sparked excitement. “Age does not diminish the extreme disappointment of having a scoop of ice cream fall from the cone.” So did at Miracle City and Miracle Heights, every employee enjoyed the pleasant evening with ice cream sticks of yummy orange, mango flavours. The Miraclites felt very blissful with the taste they had. And so, they celebrated the Ice Cream Day with full freeze bytes of ice cream and enjoyed thoroughly with their friends and fellow employees.</p>
