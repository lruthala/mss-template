           <p class="methodText"><strong>October 22nd 2015 - Miracle City & Miracle Heights IND : </strong>Dussehra, widely popular as Vijaya Dashami or Durgotsav is a festival dedicated to worship the divine mother, Goddess Durga for her victory over the demon-king Mahishasura. It is a nine day festival in which the Goddess Durga is worshipped in nine different forms. The nine days are celebrated as Maha Navratri and the tenth day as Dussehra. It is considered to be an eternally enlightening festival as we all look up to Maa Durga as the universal mother and worship her as our own mother.</p>
          <p class="methodText">
Dussehra signifies the victory over the evil. The word dussehra is emerged from sanskrit language, Dasha meaning ten and Hara, defeat, which combinedly give the meaning as Defeat over the Ten Headed Ravana by Lord Rama. So, people celebrate the victory of Lord Rama over Ravana as Dussehra. In most parts of India, effigy of Ravana is burnt on the eve of Dussehra to symbolize triumph over evil.</p><br>
