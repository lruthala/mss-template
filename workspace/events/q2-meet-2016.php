           <p class="methodText">Monsoon climate and chilling raindrops signalled an occasion to celebrate the most memorable event at Miracle. Finally, the day had come on <strong>July 23rd, 2016</strong> for enlightened Miraclites ultimately spreading joy and laughter at the auspicious event of <strong>2nd Quarterly Meet of 2016</strong> at our very own Digital Auditorium in Miracle City. The event was kick started by a warm welcome note by Mr. Siva Kusampudi, blooming greetings over the crowd, clueing speeches, fun activities, dazzling, mesmerising, and rocking performances, and heart stirring songs.

The Auditorium had become vibrant with the arrival of Mr. Prasad Lokam who inspired the audience with words. He announced that the release date of <strong>AP Cloud Initiative</strong> to be on <strong>August 05th, 2016</strong> is one the mega goals the company is marching forward in realizing the 100 thousand digital transformation skilled professionals working from Andhra Pradesh.

          <p class="methodText">The event was sparkled up with the gracious presence of Ms. Madhavi Lokam by whose inspiring address everyone at the event was immensely benefited. She had shared about <strong>Miracle’s Vision 2020 </strong> and also called <strong>the employees the greatest asset of Miracle</strong>.
