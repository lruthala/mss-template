the celebrations of <strong>Q#3 </strong>on <strong>14th October, 2017 </strong>at<strong> Miracle Heights Lawn</strong>. The
scenic beach view from the top of the hill and the pleasant climate took everyone
into the party mood. Miraclites gathered along with their family members and
enjoyed the event with lots of fun and bliss. With the presence of our honorable
CEO, <strong>Prasad Lokam </strong>, VP Global Operations, <strong>Madhavi Lokam</strong> and VP SSG (India),
<strong>Mr. Ravi Kalaga</strong> the party went even more graceful and their words left everyone
spellbound and were very inspirational as always. Also, our beloved managers and
directors uplifted the event with their speeches.</p>

<p class='methodText'>Like never before the event started with â€œ<strong>Tug of war</strong>" hosted by Keerthan Arisetty
and Ravi Teja Dadi. Many of the teams actively participated in this super exciting
event and showed their strength and the spirit of teamwork. Followed by, there
were few energetic dance performances which were eye catching and made
everyone move their feet to the music.</p>
<p class='methodText'>Along with these power packed performances there was a stunning ramp walk by
our Miraclites in western and traditional attire that enchanted everyone. And in
between an adorable and lovely little girl mesmerized the audience with her
beautifully sweet voice by singing two very soothing and popular songs.</p>
<p class="methodtext">The best performers were awarded with the token of their success for all the
efforts and commitment they have shown towards their work. All the awardees
shared their experiences and showed their gratitude towards Miracle. And our HR
Director, <strong>Ravi Ijju</strong> have talked about the successful completion of 100 ITG
batches, and also explained about how the next set of batches are going to be.</p>
<p class="methodText">Finally, the party ended up with some delicious food along with a lip smacking
dessert on the tables. Everyone enjoyed the food and party with loads of fun
which will last in their memories forever.</p>
