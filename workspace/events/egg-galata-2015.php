Eggs have always been competent both nutritionally and economically. Studies have found that eggs are one of the best protein buys. Keeping this in mind we at Miracle city and Miracle Heights celebrated Egg Galata on 20th May 2015. With summer at its peaks in the morning  and cool breeze in the evening all around Miracle, the event was celebrated with full enthusiasm.
