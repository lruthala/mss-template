                            People from all corners of India, gather at Mathura-Vrindavan every year to feel the essence of Holi in the land of Krishna. This festival holds the significant fusion of winter and summer.

                            Next morning is a free for all carnival of colours, where everyone starts splashing colours on each other with different coloured powders, coloured water and even chasing with water guns & balloons filled with coloured water for their water fight. And this would be celebrated without any discrimination of rich or poor, children or elders, man or woman and friend or stranger. It signifies the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, end of winter, and for many a festive day to meet others, play & laugh, forget & forgive, and repair ruptured relationships.
