                                The Cloud has become the go-to solution for many enterprises who want to cut down on infrastructure costs and concentrate more on their IT solutions. Enterprises are harnessing the power of the cloud to drive their enterprises towards higher quality with lowered costs and burdens. The Cloud provides enterprises with a huge source of computational power, waiting to be utilized by enterprises. Based on the needs of the enterprise the cloud can be leveraged as a Public Cloud(Shared resources), Private Cloud(Dedicated Resources) (or) a Hybrid Cloud.

                                IaaS is one of the fundamental service models provided in Cloud Computing. In this model your entire IT infrastructure can be provided as a service through the cloud providers. It includes provisions such as virtual server space, network connections, load balancers and configurations. Enterprises can utilize this infrastructure and build their own platforms on top of it to drive growth in business value. The location of data centers, present around the globe, is abstracted from the organization and in turn provides enhanced security and scalability options for them. It is a cost effective and scalable way to reduce both your IT costs and burdens.

                                The PaaS model allows users and developers to build application in the cloud. Your web browser can become an simple IDE, providing enhanced development platforms and extended services to enable your teams to build scalable high performance applications in the cloud. Deployment and Maintenance of the applications can also be done through your web console provided by the PaaS provider. Databases, Pre-Built Services, 3rd Party API’s and many more features make this model both lucrative and beneficial for the enterprise. No investment for infrastructure, and a pay-as-you-use model helps to drastically reduce and optimize your IT costs. This model also helps to reduce the time-to-market of a product by helping different teams collaborate from varied physical locations.

                                SaaS, by concept, is defined as any cloud service where the consumers can access software applications hosted in the cloud. Users can access these applications through a multitude of devices, over the internet. Unlike the regular purchase-and-install model, applications in the cloud work on a subscription based model. Automatic updates in the cloud, personalized directories and anywhere accesses are some of the basic features that drive this model. Usage is scalable and increased needs can be addressed with a single-click. Software in the cloud is not only easily scalable, but it is also customizable to ensure that it fits the enterprises brand and needs.
