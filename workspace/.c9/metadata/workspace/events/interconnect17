We'll also showcase how we were able to cut related costs by 40%.</p>","        </div>","        <div class=\"modal-footer\" style=\"padding:20px;\">","          <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>","        </div>","      </div>","      ","    </div>","  </div>","</div>","                  <!--Modal End6-->","<!-- Modal7--->","                  ","                <div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"myModal7\" role=\"dialog\">","    <div class=\"modal-dialog\">","    ","      <!-- Modal content-->","      <div class=\"modal-content\">","        <div class=\"modal-header greyback\">","          ","          <h4 class=\"modal-title\" style=\"color:#000;\"> <strong> \tDissecting the anatomy of an IoT solution with a light bulb, a drone and a really cool demo!</strong></h4>","        </div>","        <div class=\"modal-body\">","          <p class=\"methodText\" style=\"margin-bottom:-30px;\">WIFI, 4G, GSM, Zigbee, Modbus, MQTT, CanBus, and a couple more!
