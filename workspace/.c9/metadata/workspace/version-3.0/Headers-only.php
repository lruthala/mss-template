Organizations are willing to open their on-premise data and applications to partners, customers, cloud services, mobile apps and websites. This definition of the modern “Open Enterprise” is being driven by the emergence of API’s and enterprises are looking to leverage their power to cope with the ever-changing business needs.","                        </p>","                        <p class=\"methodText\">","                            API’s provide a solution to enterprises that are looking to open up new revenue streams and add value to existing infrastructure.

To tell you the truth, API’s aren’t that much different from the SOA option selected by so many enterprises.
